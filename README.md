# Verses
* Romans 3:22-24
  * 22 This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and **all are justified freely** by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. (Romans 3:22-24) 
  *  22就是　神的义，因信耶稣基督加给一切相信的人，并没有分别。 23因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了　神的荣耀； 24如今却蒙　神的恩典，因基督耶稣的救赎，就白白地称义。
* 24凡屬基督耶穌的人，是已經把肉體連肉體的邪情私慾同釘在十字架上了。（Galations 5:24）
* Don't even think about it; don't go that way. Turn away and keep moving. (Proverbs 4:15, NLT)
